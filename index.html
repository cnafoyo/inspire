    <p>“A man’s favorite donkey falls into a deep precipice. He can’t pull it out no matter how hard he tries. He therefore decides to bury it alive.<br>
Soil is poured onto the donkey from above. The donkey feels the load, shakes it off, and steps on it. More soil is poured.<br>
It shakes it off and steps up. The more the load was poured, the higher it rose. By noon, the donkey was grazing in green pastures.”</p>
